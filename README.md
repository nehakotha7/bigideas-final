This repository contains a Jupyter notebook analyzing which Pittsburgh neighborhood is the "best" to speed in according to measures we chose as a group (traffic, crash data, and speed bumps).  While each group member analyzed their own dataset, we combined our findings to come up with an answer.  This was our Big Ideas final project.
